Description: This package simulates regulations of ceRNA
    (Competing Endogenous) expression levels after a expression level
    change in one or more miRNA/mRNAs. The methodolgy adopted by the
    package has potential to incorparate any ceRNA (circRNA, lincRNA,
    etc.) into miRNA:target interaction network.  The package basically
    distributes miRNA expression over available ceRNAs where each ceRNA
    attracks miRNAs proportional to its amount. But, the package can
    utilize multiple parameters that modify miRNA effect on its target
    (seed type, binding energy, binding location, etc.).  The functions
    handle the given dataset as graph object and the processes progress
    via edge and node variables.
